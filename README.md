# Multipurpose-Computation-System

The project involves a C programming-based Calculator that supports five modes: real numbers, complex numbers, matrices, series summation, and a quit option. Each mode has its menu for performing specific operations:

1. Real Numbers: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and quadratic equation solutions.
2. Complex Numbers: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, complex conjugate, and quadratic equation solutions.
3. Matrices: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, element-wise multiplication, and transpose.
4. Series Summation: Sine, cosine, and exponential series summation.

After completing an operation, the program returns to the respective mode's menu. Each menu also includes an option to return to the main page. Additionally, a "Quit" function allows users to terminate the program.
